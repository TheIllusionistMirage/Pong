   Pong
==========

This is my version of the original Pong created by Allan Alcorn.

The is program was written by me using SFML 2.1 in Code::Blocks 12.11 IDE and compiled using the MinGW 4.7.2 compiler, under Windows 7. This game is the same as the classic one except that this contains a winderful menu and gameplay options include playing with computer and human at varying difficukty levels. The only glitch I've noticed is that this game runs a little slow on computers using less than 2 GB RAM otherwise it works fine. Also, I would like to CLEARLY state that this game is not written in the most efficient ay to use CPU and resources economically but nonetheless, is quite smooth. Hope you like it. :)
