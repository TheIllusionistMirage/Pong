   About Pong
================


This is my version of the original Pong created by Allan Alcorn(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).

This program was written by me using C++/SFML 2.1 in Code::Blocks 12.11 IDE and compiled using the MinGW 4.7.2 compiler, under Windows 7. This game is the same as the classic one except that this contains a wonderful menu and gameplay options include playing with computer and human at varying difficulty levels. The only glitch I've noticed is that this game runs a little slow on computers using less than 2 GB RAM otherwise it works fine. Also, I would like to CLEARLY state that this game is not written in the most efficient way to use CPU and resources economically but nonetheless, it is quite smooth.

I also strongly feel that the source will be VERY VERY useful for first timers who are into game programming since I've tried to make it object oriented and efficient as much as possible and have documented it too. So, no one would be more happy than me if someone finds this code useful for learning.

The program is licensed under zlib/libpng License. So, feel free to do whatever you want with it.


Hope you like it. :)


CHEERS! :D
