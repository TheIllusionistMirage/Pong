   About Pong
================


This is my version of the famous Pong created by Allan Alcorn (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).

This program was written in C++ using SFML 2.1. This game contains a wonderful menu and gameplay options include playing with computer and human at varying difficulty levels.

**NOTE**:-
I would like to CLEARLY state that this game is not written in the most efficient way to use CPU and resources since this was the very first 'program' I wrote. **The game also doesn't implement a [fixed timestep][1]!**

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code.
